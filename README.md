```
npm run dev
```

## Build if you want
```
npm run build

## Description
This project explores some of the UI elements from shadcn UI library, which is pretty cool. It provides full customization despite being a component library. It uses tailwind, so better setup prettier-tailwind-plugin. Checkout shadcn for more components. May be I will do a full UI display just to get familiar with all the components. **lucide-react** is also a cool icon library. The app is written in NextJS with App router.
